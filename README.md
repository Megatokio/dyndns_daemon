# dyndns_daemon

### a dynDNS update daemon

This is a simple deamon for updating a domain at a dynDNS service.

You also need https://github.com/megatokio/Libraries in the same directory (or change the symlink) and libcurl.

The daemon is developed and tested on Linux but should work on most unixes too.

The .pro file is for the Qt Creator IDE
and a Makefile is also provided.

#### Currently supported:
* IP v4

#### Planned:
* IP v6
