# dyndns_daemon

### a dynDNS update daemon

This is a simple daemon for updating a domain with a web server at a dynamic DNS service.
It can update a IPv4 address, a IPv6 address or a IPv4 plus IPv6 address.

The daemon is developed and tested on Linux but should work on most unixes too.

The .pro file is for the Qt Creator IDE
and a Makefile is also provided.
