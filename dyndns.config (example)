# The query string defines which interfaces (IPv4 and/or IPv6) are updated.

# Up to 3 query strings can be given for IPv4 only, IPv6 only and IPv4 plus IPv6
# depending on which interface(s) your web server listens to.

# If both interfaces are defined but only one works, then only the working interface is updated
# and the other one is removed from the DNS. The single-IP versions needed to to this are
# automatically deferred if the IPs are defined in 2 separate variables as in the example above.

# Instead of pinging your web server root directory you can ping any other file.
# ping only fetches the HEAD.
